# Data-Science-Coding

This repository is a curated collection of **DS and SQL problem solutions** Iâ€™ve worked on as part of my data science prep. The questions are sourced from popular platforms like **HackerRank** and **StrataScratch**, helping me sharpen data querying and analytical thinking.

## ðŸ”¹ HackerRank (MySQL)

Contains SQL questions from HackerRankâ€™s *SQL domain* especially focused on **MySQL**.  
Topics covered include:

- SELECT statements  
- JOIN operations  
- Aggregations and GROUP BY  
- Subqueries and Window Functions  

ðŸ›  Most queries are written in **MySQL-compatible SQL** but can be adapted to other dialects easily.

## ðŸ”¹ StrataScratch

Includes real-world SQL problems from **StrataScratch**, often asked in **data analyst/data science interviews**.  
Problems range from **beginner to advanced**, covering:

- Data cleaning and filtering  
- CTEs and subqueries  
- Joins and aggregations  
- Window functions  

## ðŸ—‚ **Folder structure**  
Each file is named after the problem, e.g., `select_basics.sql`, `employee_salarys.sql`, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This repository is a **work in progress**, and will continue to grow as I solve more problems.
- All solutions use **standard SQL syntax** where possible, with a focus on **MySQL** dialects.
- Useful for **interview prep**, **concept revision** and building **SQL fluency** for data roles.
